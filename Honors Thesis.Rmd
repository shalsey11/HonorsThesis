```

## Beginnings
Here, I am installing various packages necessary to complete this project. Packages include tidyverse,...
I am also reading in the survey data, titling it 'survey'.

```{r install-packages, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
library(naniar)
```

```{r reading-in-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
survey <- read_csv("Mental Health Among Collegiate Athletes2.csv")
glimpse(survey)
```



## Data Wrangling

We also need to rename the variables to make them easier to work with. 
Variables needed to clean up:
*Are you on an athletic team? --> athlete
*Major(or intended, if not yet declared) --> major1
*Are you obtaining a Bachelors of Science or Bachelors of Arts for Major? --> degree1
*Second Major(if applicable) --> major2
*Are you obtaining a Bachelors of Science or Bachelors of Arts for Major#2? --> degree2
*Cumulative GPA (Round to 2 decimal places) --> cumgpa
*Major GPA (Round to 2 decimal places) --> majorgpa

```{r renaming-variables}
survey1 <- survey %>%
  rename(athlete = `Are you on an athletic team at Meredith College?`,
         major1 = `Major (or intended, if not yet declared)`,
         degree1 = `Are you obtaining a Bachelors of Arts or Bachelors of Science for Major?`,
         major2 =  `Second Major (if applicable)`,
         degree2 = `Are you obtaining a Bachelors of Arts or Bachelors of Science for Major #2? (if applicable)`,
         cumgpa = `Cumulative GPA (round to 2 decimal places)`,
         majorgpa = `Major GPA (round to 2 decimal places)`)
```

```

creating new variable that sums all of anxiety symptoms

```{r  total-anxiety}
survey1$anxiety_total = rowSums(survey1[c(9:29)])
view(survey1)
```


Renaming rest of the variables:

```{r renaming-rest-of-variables}
survey1 <- survey1 %>%
  rename(seek_help = `Would you seek help for anxiety?`,
         years_college_sport = `How many years have you been a collegiate athlete?`,
         freq_play = `Based on your frequency of participating, how would you classify your status in your sport?`,
         years_sport = `How long have you been playing your sport competitively? (Please just type number of years)`,
         concussion = `How many times have you had a concussion? (if any)`)
```



We need to clean up some of this data, including making variables binary. The variables we are making binary are as follows:
*athlete  --> no = 0, yes = 1
*degree1 --> BA = 0, BS = 1
*degree2--> BA = 0, BS = 1
*concussion --> 0 = 1, 1,2,3,4,5+ = 1

```{r binary-variables-athlete}
survey1<- survey1 %>%
    mutate(athlete = case_when(athlete == "Yes" ~ "1",
                              athlete == "No" ~ "0"),
           athlete = as.factor(athlete))
```

```{r binary-variables-degree1}
survey1<- survey1 %>%
  mutate(degree1 = case_when(degree1 == "Bachelors of Science" ~ "1",
                              degree1 == "Bachelors of Arts" ~ "0"),
           degree1 = as.factor(degree1))
```

```{r binary-variables-degree2}

  mutate(degree2 = case_when(degree2 == "Bachelors of Science" ~ "1",
                              degree2 == "Bachelors of Arts" ~ "0"),
           degree2 = as.factor(degree2))
```

```{r binary-variables-concussion}

         concussion = as.factor(concussion))
```


## Categorizing Variables

Need to categorize major, GPA, anxiety_total, and sport (team vs. individual)
- Major is by overall department, per Meredith College.
- GPA categories 
- Anxiety total levels based on Beck Anxiety Inventory
    - 0 - 21 --> "0"
    - 22 - 63 --> "1"

```

```{r dropping-graduates}

According to Beck Anxiety Inventory, those who have a score of 0-21 indicates very low anxiety. Those in the range of 22-35 have moderate anxiety, and those who have a sum of over 36 indicates severe anxiety.
In order to make this variable binary, I collapsed the moderate and severe anxiety group into one group. Those who have a range of 22-63 would be designtated with 1, while those with less than 22 would be given a 0.

```{r making-anxiety_total-binary }
survey1 <- survey1 %>%
  mutate(anxiety_total_level = case_when(anxiety_total >= 22 ~ "1",
                                        TRUE ~ "0"),
                  anxiety_total_level = as.factor(anxiety_total_level))
view(survey1)
```


We then categorize sport. If it is a team sport or individual. 
Team Sports: Basketball, Softball, Soccer, Volleyball, Lacrosse, Field Hockey --> will be distinguished with a 1
Individual: Golf, Track & Field, Cross Country, Tennis --> will be distinguished with a  0

```{r cateogorizing-binary-sport}
survey1 <- survey1 %>%
  mutate(sport_group = case_when(Sport == "Basketball" ~ "1",
                                 Sport == "Softball" ~ "1",
                                 Sport == "Soccer" ~ "1",
                                 Sport == "Volleyball" ~ "1",
                                 Sport == "Lacrosse" ~ "1",
